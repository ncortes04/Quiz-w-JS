This was yet another challenging yet fun activity that i have put quite a few hours into. I was given the task of making a quiz. I had searched the web to see how to even start such a task and found that many people had stared there answers in an array. I had seen others store thier answers in a seperate js file but that was too complicated. i started by creating my simple html that consist of only a few lines adn then linked it to th css. I used the css to style and create containers for the webpage. I then created my javascript file and linked my buttons to the javascript and created variouis functions to show them when needed. I made it so when the start button is pressed it randomly assorts the quetions and clears the previous questions. When the answer is correct the background is changhed to green and if it is incorrect it is changed to red. This was donw with the classlist.add. Overall i belie i have created  adecent quiz that may not look pretty but i am proud i have made it this far.
